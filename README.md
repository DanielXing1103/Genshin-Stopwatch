# Genshin Stopwatch
### A program to help keep track of Genshin Impact's time gates.

## How does it work?

Genshin Stopwatch is a program that is does not require an internet connection to use and does not run in the background. When you start up the program it will calculate the difference between when you started the program and when the destination of said timer is.

When you close the application your stopwatches will save to a `save.txt` file. The save file is easily configurable and easy to read. Here is an example of a stopwatch's save data in `save.txt`:

> Name: Parametric Transformer<br>
> Time Finished: 2023-03-19 20:07:18<br>
> Time Original Duration: 168:00:00<br>
> Border Color: #37AA9C<br>
> Notes:<br>

## What platforms is this compatible with?

At the moment only Windows machines can run this program, I'm not sure if I plan on making mobile versions.
